1.I didn't take any outer API . I created the api by locally. if anyone want to run this app then they should run the json-server first. 
I created json-server and use that api in my whole assignment so please first start the json-server and port it at 8000 and then check the functionality.
Todo part is totally private no one can access todo part without login. if someone want to have access of todo then they should login first.
They have to use email- "jaiswalshivam9399@gmail.com" password - "jaiswal9399"
